/**
 * Example classes for the generic expression editor.
 * 
 * <p> This demo demonstrates the possibility of the generic expression editor. 
 * <p>We propose a simple editor for arithmetic expressions, with two kinds of tree nodes : operations and 
 * numbers.
 * <p> In order to show the system in its full generality, the root node is supposed to correspond to an implicit "+".
 * <p> If you want to have an explicit root, a simple change in the popup menu builder could prevent adding any new node in the root.
